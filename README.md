EV-TRADER

About Contentstack: Contentstack is a headless CMS with an API-first approach that puts content at the centre. It is designed to simplify the process of publication by separating code from content.

About this project: EV-Trader is a POC designed to answer the question, what would an application that allowed the trade of electronic vehicles look like? Ev-Trader is built on top of Contentstack’s powerful headless CMS. With a fully responsive design, Ev-Trader was designed to be used on any device.

Features of Ev-Trader include:
Contentstacks Headless CMS. A powerful Content Management System. Using EV-Trader, customers can upload their vehicle and vehicle information to “The Stack”. A Site Administrator can then review the submission and publish it to the website.   

Algolia Search Integration. A powerful search solution that allows users to conduct real time searches.

Enhancements:
A developer that wanted to enhance the features of EV-Trader might consider doing some of the following:
Develop a login system that will allow authenticated access to customers. 
Develop an offer system that will allow those users to submit offers to the vehicle owner.
